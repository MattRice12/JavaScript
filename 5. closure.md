# What:
  A closure is an inner function that has access to the outer (enclosing) function's variablesâ€”scope chain.
  The closure has three scope chains:
    1) it has access to its own scope (variables defined between its curly brackets),
    2) it has access to the outer function's variables, and
    3) it has access to the global variables.


# Why
  A closure can make the creation of very similar functions ultra-effective

# Closures retain counter
