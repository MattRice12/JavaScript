# Basics
  Switch will allow us to assign a weapon based on a value itself, without a Boolean check.


  function Knight (name, regiment){
    this.name = name;
    this.regiment = regiment;
    switch (regiment) {
      case 1:
        this.weapon = "Broadsword";
        break;
      case 2:
        this.weapon = "Claymore";
        break;
      case 3:
        this.weapon = "Longsword";
        break;
    }
  }

# Default
  default: this.weapon = "Short sword";

# Fall-through
  Without a 'break', the assignment falls through each case statement from the place you start.

  The final break is optional.

# Hierarchical code execution
  Fall-through allows things higher in the hierarchy to receive lower level qualities:

  function ceremonialDagger(knight, rank){
    this.length = 8;
    this.owner = knight;
    switch(rank){
      case "King": this.diamonds = 1;
      case "High Constable": this.amethyst = 2;
      case "Field Marshal": this.sapphires = 4;
      case "Captain": this.emeralds = 1;
      case "Knight": this.rubies = 6;
    }
  }

  var knightsDagger = new ceremonialDagger("Jerome", "Knight");
  var marshalsDagger = new ceremonialDagger("Timothy", "Field Marshal");
