# Variables
Initialize variables with *var* --- when changing the variable later, you don't have to say *var* again.

Increaasing a variable by 1: * thisVariable++
n++   ====   n += 1   ====   n = n + 1

## Methods:
* .length --> returns length of string
* .charAt(n) --> returns character at that index
* console.log() --> prints to console

## Scripts
<script src = "File.js"></script>

## Loops

* while loop
var n = 1;
while( n <= 8){
  console.log("Number:" + n + " does stuff");
  n++;
}


* for loop
for(var thing = 1; thing < 10; thing++) {
  console.log("Number: " + thing)
}
