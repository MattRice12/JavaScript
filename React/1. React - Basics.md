# What is React?
  React is a JS library for building UIs.

# Virtual DOM -- Speed
  The virtual DOM is an in-memory representation of real DOM elements generated by React components before any changes are made to the page.

  The Virtual DOM is what allows React to be fast.

  Virtual DOM *Diffing*: allows React to minimize changes to the DOM as a result of user actions -- therefore, increasing browser performance

  This is like caching: rather than rendering the entire DOM again, when a change is made in the Virtual DOM, ONLY that part of the real DOM is changed. So rather than re-rendering the entire DOM, only the touched part is re-rendered.

# Example
  class RobotBox extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return <div>Hello From React</div>;
    }
  }

  let target = document.getElementById('robot-app');

  ReactDOM.render( <RobotBox />, target );
